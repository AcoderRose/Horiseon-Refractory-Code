# Horiseon-Refractory-Code

## Description

### I optimized an existing website by implementing refactoring strategies to improve its accessibility. This makes sure that the website is more user friendly.

- Enhancing the accessibility of our website makes it simpler and more navigable for all users, thereby expanding its potential audience reach.

- I incorporated semantic HTML elements to provide the content with clearly defined structure.

- In reviewing the HTML structure, I observed a logical arrangement of elements.

- I assessed the icon and image elements, then added alt descriptions to the images.

- I reorganized the CSS by combining selectors and properties to maintain a semantic structure. Additionally, I incorporated comments within the CSS code for improved clarity.
